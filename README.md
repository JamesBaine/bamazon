Bamazon is a node app that is a simplified e-commerce platform that links to a mysql database to track Products and inventory.

In the screenshot below you can see the app running in node.

The first top of the image shows the sql table in it's initial state.

The app then asks the user which item they would like to buy and the asks them how many they would like to buy. In this intance the user decides to buy 10 MacBook Pros.

The app then subtracts 10 MacBooks from the inventory of 205.

It then prints out the updated table with a noew total of 195 Macbooks.

The user then presses Q to quit.
